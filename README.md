# BMI Analysis Project

### ðŸ“‹ Project Overview
This project is designed to analyze and predict Body Mass Index (BMI) using a dataset and machine learning algorithms. The project aims to provide insights into the BMI distribution and build a model to classify individuals into BMI categories based on their physical attributes.

### ðŸ›  Tech Stack
Programming Language: Python
Libraries Used: pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn
Algorithm: Random Forest Classifier / Decision Tree / Logistic Regression (whichever you used)
Tools: Jupyter Notebook, VS Code
### ðŸ“Š Problem Statement
The Body Mass Index (BMI) is a measure used to determine if a person has a healthy weight for a given height. The goal of this project is to analyze BMI data, create visualizations to understand BMI trends, and build a machine learning model to predict BMI categories such as Underweight, Normal, Overweight, and Obese based on input features.

### ðŸš€ Project Workflow
Data Collection: A dataset containing information about individuals' heights, weights, and corresponding BMI values.
Data Preprocessing:
Handling missing data
Removing outliers if needed
Encoding categorical variables if applicable
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Visualizations using histograms, box plots, and scatter plots to understand relationships between features and BMI.
Correlation analysis to find influential features.
Feature Engineering:
Adding BMI category labels based on BMI values.
Normalizing/Scaling features to improve model performance.
Model Building:
Training a machine learning model (e.g., Random Forest Classifier) to predict BMI categories.
Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
Evaluating model performance using accuracy, precision, and recall scores.
Model Evaluation:
Visualizing model predictions using a confusion matrix.
Comparing different machine learning models.

### ðŸ“ˆ Key Insights
Statistical distribution of BMI across different age groups and genders.
The relationship between height, weight, and BMI using visualizations.
Performance metrics of the machine learning model in classifying BMI categories.
